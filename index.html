                      Meet as many people as you can and don’t be afraid to take
                      advantage of opportunities that will get you more involved
                      with the department! One of the many things that makes our
                      department so special is every. single. person. in it. You
                      would be amazed at the stories you will hear in our small
                      CS community alone. As mentioned, this includes getting
                      involved! Getting involved with our CS Ambassador program
                      as a community college transfer student started as an
                      opportunity to share my passion for CS and is now wrapping
                      up as not only that but a family gained. The connections
                      you make today in your college experience are those that
                      you will have the rest of your life - don’t ever be afraid
                      to make them.

                      What's one of your favorite memories/experiences from the
                      CS Department?
                    </h4>
                    <p class="student-text">
                      One of the memories that stands out to me was my first
                      semester starting at JMU as a college junior and was at a
                      particularly low moment in my life. During the last bit of
                      the semester, my grandfather passed away and me and my
                      family took it really hard. While this could’ve been a
                      breaking point for my academics after a whole semester, my
                      CS professors lended their hands in making sure that
                      didn’t happen. I have never in my life been so positively
                      overwhelmed with the amount of support I received during
                      that time and will be something I cherish for the rest of
                      my life. When I say JMU CS has become a family to me, I
                      mean it in every sense of the word. Regardless of where we
                      come from or where we are in our life, our CS department
                      has a place for all of us.

                    <h4 class="student-header">
                      Anything else you'd like to share?
                    </h4>
                    <p class="student-text">
                      I’d like to personally thank each and every one of the CS
                      faculty and staff for making my experience with the
                      department so special. Being so welcomed, even as a junior
                      transfer from community college, says something about how
                      special JMU is. I am fully prepared to take my many skills
                      learned during my time within the department into the real
                      world, and I truly feel as though it says a lot about what
                      we have. Oh, and one last thing: GO DUKES!

                      as a community college transfer student started as an
                      opportunity to share my passion for CS and is now wrapping

                      you will have the rest of your life - don’t ever be afraid
                      to make them.

                      One of the memories that stands out to me was my first
                      semester starting at JMU as a college junior and was at a
                      particularly low moment in my life. During the last bit of
                      the semester, my grandfather passed away and me and my
                      family took it really hard. While this could’ve been a
                      breaking point for my academics after a whole semester, my
                      CS professors lended their hands in making sure that
                      didn’t happen. I have never in my life been so positively
                      overwhelmed with the amount of support I received during
                      that time and will be something I cherish for the rest of
                      my life. When I say JMU CS has become a family to me, I
                      mean it in every sense of the word. Regardless of where we
                      come from or where we are in our life, our CS department
                      has a place for all of us.

                      I’d like to personally thank each and every one of the CS

                      department so special. Being so welcomed, even as a junior
                      transfer from community college, says something about how
                      special JMU is. I am fully prepared to take my many skills
                      learned during my time within the department into the real
                      world, and I truly feel as though it says a lot about what

                      as a community college transfer student started as an
                      opportunity to share my passion for CS and is now wrapping

                      to make them.

                      What's one of your favorite memories/experiences from the
                      CS Department?

                    <p class="student-text">
                      One of the memories that stands out to me was my first
                      semester starting at JMU as a college junior and was at a
                      particularly low moment in my life. During the last bit of
                      the semester, my grandfather passed away and me and my
                      family took it really hard. While this could’ve been a
                      breaking point for my academics after a whole semester, my
                      CS professors lended their hands in making sure that
                      didn’t happen. I have never in my life been so positively
                      overwhelmed with the amount of support I received during
                      that time and will be something I cherish for the rest of
                      my life. When I say JMU CS has become a family to me, I
                      mean it in every sense of the word. Regardless of where we
                      come from or where we are in our life, our CS department
                      has a place for all of us.

                    <p class="student-text">
                      I’d like to personally thank each and every one of the CS
                      faculty and staff for making my experience with the
                      department so special. Being so welcomed, even as a junior
                      transfer from community college, says something about how
                      special JMU is. I am fully prepared to take my many skills
                      learned during my time within the department into the real
                      world, and I truly feel as though it says a lot about what
                      we have. Oh, and one last thing: GO DUKES!

                    </h4>
                    <p class="student-text">
                      One of the memories that stands out to me was my first
                      semester starting at JMU as a college junior and was at a
                      particularly low moment in my life. During the last bit of
                      the semester, my grandfather passed away and me and my
                      family took it really hard. While this could’ve been a
                      breaking point for my academics after a whole semester, my
                      CS professors lended their hands in making sure that
                      didn’t happen. I have never in my life been so positively
                      overwhelmed with the amount of support I received during
                      that time and will be something I cherish for the rest of
                      my life. When I say JMU CS has become a family to me, I
                      mean it in every sense of the word. Regardless of where we
                      come from or where we are in our life, our CS department
                      has a place for all of us.

                      Anything else you'd like to share?
                    </h4>
                    <p class="student-text">
                      I’d like to personally thank each and every one of the CS
                      faculty and staff for making my experience with the
                      department so special. Being so welcomed, even as a junior
                      transfer from community college, says something about how
                      special JMU is. I am fully prepared to take my many skills
                      learned during my time within the department into the real
                      world, and I truly feel as though it says a lot about what
                      we have. Oh, and one last thing: GO DUKES!

                      as a community college transfer student started as an
                      opportunity to share my passion for CS and is now wrapping
                      up as not only that but a family gained. The connections
                      you make today in your college experience are those that
                      you will have the rest of your life - don’t ever be afraid
                      to make them.
