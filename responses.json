      "advice": "Meet as many people as you can and don’t be afraid to take advantage of opportunities that will get you more involved with the department! One of the many things that makes our department so special is every. single. person. in it. You would be amazed at the stories you will hear in our small CS community alone. As mentioned, this includes getting involved! Getting involved with our CS Ambassador program as a community college transfer student started as an opportunity to share my passion for CS and is now wrapping up as not only that but a family gained. The connections you make today in your college experience are those that you will have the rest of your life - don’t ever be afraid to make them.",
      "memories": "One of the memories that stands out to me was my first semester starting at JMU as a college junior and was at a particularly low moment in my life. During the last bit of the semester, my grandfather passed away and me and my family took it really hard. While this could’ve been a breaking point for my academics after a whole semester, my CS professors lended their hands in making sure that didn’t happen. I have never in my life been so positively overwhelmed with the amount of support I received during that time and will be something I cherish for the rest of my life. When I say JMU CS has become a family to me, I mean it in every sense of the word. Regardless of where we come from or  where we are in our life, our CS department has a place for all of us.",
      "plans": "",
      "extra": "I’d like to personally thank each and every one of the CS faculty and staff for making my experience with the department so special. Being so welcomed, even as a junior transfer from community college, says something about how special JMU is. I am fully prepared to take my many skills learned during my time within the department into the real world, and I truly feel as though it says a lot about what we have. Oh, and one last thing: GO DUKES!"

      "advice": "Engage as much as possible with Computer Science students and faculty! There are so many opportunities for friendship, knowledge, mentorship, research, and careers. Try out the many clubs we have and communicate often with our professors to learn about additional ways to challenge yourself with Computer Science. It may take longer than 4 years to find out what your passion in CS is, so if you work hard to find it early on you can really help yourself out!",
      "memories": "My favorite memories with the CS department were definitely when I found myself up late working on programming assignments in the computer labs. I met so many of my best friends from struggling through code together. The lab was also a fun place to hang out between classes and meet peers in the department. Outside of school, going on camping trips with my CS friends was always a great way to de-stress and have fun away from school-work.",

      "extra": "Computer Science can be very challenging sometimes, but it important to remember that you don't have to learn it on your own. Professors are always there to help and give guidance. 4 years go by fast, make the most of it!"

      "memories": "I loved how welcoming the environment was my first year at JMU. College was a new and scary place, but joining Coders Anonymous was such an amazing decision I made, as well as getting involved with the intramural teams or clubs really helped me find my groove in the CS department.",
      "plans": "I really want to explore technical consulting or analytics since I love analyzing new applications and working with clients. I may also explore some of my own talents in game or app design, and maybe even spike an interest in robotics or AI. There's so many new technologies it's hard to ever get bored in this industry.",
      "extra": "I can confidently say JMU's CS program is a lot more involving and different than my friends in other programs at other schools have said. I have loved my time here and wish I could've been here longer, make the most of it, for sure."

As a CS student you’ll be here to learn, and you’re not expected to immediately know everything. I think to get the most from this department, simply give it your best effort, be patient with yourself as you learn, and your efforts will be reciprocated.",
      "memories": "One of my favorite memories involves the CS student room in the department hall. Jokingly, this room was named: “Dr. Bower’s Auxiliary Office.” The nice thing about this room was getting to interact with other students, work on problems together, and occasionally talk with a faculty member that dropped by. However, one of my favorite memories was when myself and other students began making the room our own. We decided the florescent lighting was a bit draining, and so I offered to bring in a standing lamp from home. So, there I was. A junior CS major in early hours of a windy winter morning carrying a 5-ft tall lamp across the parking lot by Rose Library to the ISAT building. I can’t help but laugh at how comical the moment was. But the CS department really made me feel at home.",
      "plans": "I plan to join the work force for the time being. Eventually, I would like to work towards a master’s degree, or if I’ve had enough coffee, I might consider pursuing a PhD in Computer Science as I would like to end up teaching the subject.",
      "extra": "If I could share advice with my younger self, I would encourage curiosity when it comes to learning. I think it’s easy to fall into the mentality of learning for the sake of maintaining grades, which results in memorization over true learning and understanding. My experience in undergrad has taught me that learning isn’t about memorizing facts at all (well, you’ll have to memorize some of course). But learning is really about how to think, analyze, and (in CS/math at least) problem solve. So, be curious. Don’t settle for factualization. In other words, don’t stop at simply knowing that (binary) 0010 = 2 (decimal), ask yourself: “Why is this true?” and follow the trail. I learned and retained more thinking this way rather than trying to memorize factual elements."

      "memories": "I have so many! I'll never forget volunteering at EYH and DIGITAL and seeing young girls try programming the first time. One of my favorite things from all of college was camping with CS people. Being in the lab between classes or during TA hours. Playing D&D! Going to chili's! Sitting in Dr. Weikle's red chair.
